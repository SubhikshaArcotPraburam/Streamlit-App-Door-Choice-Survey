    Dear Participant,

    Thank you for your interest in this study!

    In this survey, we explore how passengers choose between different subway doors when boarding a train.

    ---

    Please read the following information carefully before starting the survey.

    **Set-up:**

    Imagine you are standing on a subway platform, about to decide where to wait for an arriving train. 
    You haven‚Äôt positioned yourself yet and must now choose a spot on the platform.

  

    ---

    **How it works?**

    - You'll see 12 decision tasks, each showing 2 subway doors (A, B).
    - For each task, compare the doors and select the one you'd choose to board from.
    - All doors are part of the same train, arriving now.
    - Make your decision as if you're on the platform in real life.
